Overview: This project focuses on applying temporal reasoning algorithms to solve tasks in two different scenarios: the Little Prince environment and a simplified speech recognition system. The objective is to determine the most probable sequence of hidden states in a POMDP given a sequence of actions and observations.

Environment setup similar to the "Little Prince" scenario.

Objective: Determine the most likely sequence of states given actions and observations.

Simplified Speech Recognition: Deals with resolving ambiguities in speech-to-text conversion using phoneme-to-text fragment mappings.

Objective: Find the best sequence of text fragments for a given sequence of phonemes.

Viterbi Algorithm: Implement the Viterbi algorithm to determine the most probable sequence of hidden states in a POMDP.

Normalization: Convert weight values to probabilities for state transitions, initial state probabilities, and observation probabilities.

Performance Metrics: Evaluate the algorithm based on the probability of the predicted state sequence compared to the known sequence.
